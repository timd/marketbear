DATA
====

Applicaiton state is saved into data/state.yml.  The latest market value from the
datafile is stored, and used to calculate the change in the market price on each run.
The colour for the bear's eye change is set according to:

State				Eye colour		RED value	GREEN value
-----				----------		---------	-----------
Market up			Green			0			255
Market same			Yellow			255			255
Market down			Red				255			0

Application state is saved into data/state.yml. The latest year and month from
the datafile is stored, and checked against the datafile on each run. If the 
latest date has not changed, updates are not sent out.
